// Overview
lab4c_tcp.c
	The source code to create the program lab4c_tcp, which uses the aio and gpio APIs with the 
	Edison to sample temperature and button presses. This program generates reports based 
	on a user specified frequency. The user also has the option to change temperature scales, 
	toggle temperature reports, and shut it down during execution of the program. The generated
	reports are sent to a server via a socket and port number 18000. The program is also able to
	receive and process commands from the server, changing the output of the reports.

lab4c_tls.c
	Same as lab4c_tcp.c but different in that this program communicates with the server (port 
	number 19000) via encrypted messages. This includes encrypted time and temperature reports,
	as well as the commands. 

Makefile
	default ... builds both tcp and tls programs
	clean 	... delete all generated programs and output
	dist 	... (runnable on a Linux desktop or server) create the deliverable tarball

make_check.sh
	The shell script that is used in make check to execute smoke tests.
