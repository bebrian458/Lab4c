	on a user specified frequency. The user also has the option to change temperature scales, 
	toggle temperature reports, and shut it down during exectuion of the program.

Makefile
	default ... build your program
	check 	... execute an automated smoke-test of your application to see if it runs and can 
				talk to its sensors actuators.
	clean 	... delete all generated programs and output
	dist 	... (runnable on a Linux desktop or server) create the deliverable tarball

make_check.sh
	The shell script that is used in make check to execute smoke tests.


// Research
Used powerpoint and discussion for tips on how to use aio and gpio
Used man pages, stack overflow, and piazza for syntax help and logic flow
